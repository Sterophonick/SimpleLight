 I've created miniLZO for projects where it is inconvenient to
 include (or require) the full LZO source code just because you
 want to add a little bit of data compression to your application.

 miniLZO implements the LZO1X-1 compressor and both the standard and
 safe LZO1X decompressor. Apart from fast compression it also useful
 for situations where you want to use pre-compressed data files (which
 must have been compressed with LZO1X-999).

 miniLZO consists of one C source file and two header files:
    minilzo.c
    minilzo.h
    lzoconf.h

 To use miniLZO just copy these files into your source directory, add
 minilzo.c to your Makefile and #include minilzo.h from your program.
 Note: you also must distribute this file (`README.LZO') with your project.

 minilzo.o compiles to about 6 kB (using gcc or Watcom C on a i386), and
 the sources are about 14 kB when packed with zip - so there's no more
 excuse that your application doesn't support data compression :-)

 For more information, documentation, example programs and other support
 files (like Makefiles and build scripts) please download the full LZO
 package from
    http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/lzo.html

 Have fun,
  Markus


 P.S. minilzo.c is generated automatically from the LZO sources and
      therefore functionality is completely identical


 Appendix A: building miniLZO
 ----------------------------
 miniLZO is written such a way that it should compile and run
 out-of-the-box on most machines.

 If you are running on a very unusual architecture and lzo_init() fails then
 you should first recompile with `-DLZO_DEBUG' to see what causes the failure.
 The most probable case is something like `sizeof(char *) != sizeof(long)'.
 After identifying the problem you can compile by adding some defines
 like `-DSIZEOF_CHAR_P=8' to your Makefile.

 The best solution is (of course) using Autoconf - if your project uses
 Autoconf anyway just add `-DMINILZO_HAVE_CONFIG_H' to your compiler
 flags when compiling minilzo.c. See the LZO distribution for an example
 how to set up configure.in.
